		<h1>LIFE BEFORE BLOGGING</h1>
 

<p class="para">I’m originally from Quebec, Canada. Back in the days, I used to be a social worker. I used to travel once a year for about a month and I was always spending my summers in Europe since I was 20 years old. In June 2014, I started my journey around the world at the age of 25.

		<h1>LIFE ON THE ROAD</h1>
 

<p class="para">
 

I first started my journey in the Canadian Rockies where I hitch-hiked my way around. Then, I moved to Australia for two years. I started A Broken Backpack in July 2015. Back at the time, I was working on a farm in Australia, and I needed something to stay entertained. Quickly, A Broken Backpack became popular.

After Australia, I decided to go on a backpacking trip to Southeast Asia. Later on, I moved to the UK for a bit less than a year.

In October 2017, I decided to move to Southeast Asia. Bali became my home for about one and a half years.

In 2019, I was based mostly in Thailand.

In 2020, I moved to Bulgaria.

Of course, I do plan some occasional trips in and there, but since I’m running an online business and a few successful blogs, I prefer slow travel.
